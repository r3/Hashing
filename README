This is a sandbox for testing hashing algorithms and open-addressing options based on collision statistics and
performance of algorithms. The hashing project was started as homework for my data structures class, and is built
the the specifications found at the following wiki page:

http://cse222.wikispaces.com/Good%20Recipe%20for%20Hash

The project, as it stands, is incomplete and in active development.

Using a framework prototype dictionary in the hashish script, I iterate over hash/addressing methods available in
separate modules (buildhash_funs and rehash_funs) to employ a test function which inject these methods and runs a
standardized test. Results can be redirected from the standard output through parameters passed to the function.
